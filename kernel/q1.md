Kernel question
===============
In WeensyOS, the kernel live sin addresses starting with `0x40000`, while processes live virtual memory starting with address 0x10000.

**QUESTION 1A**
Where is the stack located relative to the kernel in WeensyOS? Provide some intuition as to why the stack is located where it is.

**QUESTION 1B**
What pages should the user be able to access? 

**QUESTION 1C**
Recall that `sys_page_alloc(addr)` allocates a physical page given a virtual address `addr`, and if unable to do so, returns `-1`. Let's assume that `syscall_page_alloc` correctly implements `sys_page_alloc` in that it returns a physical address if it can allocate a new one and the virtual address meets certain specifications, otherwise it returns -1.

Let's look at the WeensyOS implementation of `sys_page_alloc` taken from the `syscall` function. 
```
case SYSCALL_PAGE_ALLOC:
        if (syscall_page_alloc() == -1) {
            panic("Unable to allocate page");
        }
        else {
            return syscall_page_alloc(current->regs.reg_rdi);
        }
```
What are some issues and concerns with this code?
